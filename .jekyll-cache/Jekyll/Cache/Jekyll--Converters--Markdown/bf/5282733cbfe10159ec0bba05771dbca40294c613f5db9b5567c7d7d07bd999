<blockquote>
  <p>Status Quo Of TOD In Boston (Through comparison &amp; GIS analysis)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Stage 1: We compared Boston with Arlington, whose TOD system is quite successful. We studied from the points of accessibility, parking, open space, land use, and income difference, to learn where and how the TOD station should be.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Stage 2: We extracted the points above in with GIS data of Boston to found out which site is the existing TOD and which site needs more.</li>
</ul>
