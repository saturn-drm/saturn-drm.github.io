<h2 id="the-intensification-in-built-site">The Intensification In Built Site</h2>

<p>The urban space is continually expanding over the years, with the distance growing, the resources being depleted and the pollution worsening.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/02/13/TSypPEtfKOkB3gX.jpg" alt="04loc.jpg" /></p>

<p>However, have the existing urban land been fully developed and utilized?</p>

<p>When space so-called left for landscape is transformed into an urban area with a specific density, will the city be more active?</p>

<p>What kind of relationships should be developed between buildings? 
What kind of synergy can be formed? 
Can we build organic and smart cities, neighborhoods, and homes?</p>

<p>Based on these thinkings, the topic is focused on the existing urban space - the space between the main entrance and administrative building in Tsinghua.</p>
