<p>The project is located on the void space between the entrance and administrative building at Tsinghua, aimed to intensify the functions here and to explore the relationships among each building, activating the space, inviting people onto the site, and offering daily service for students, tourists, and professors.</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Parking Intensification - Solve the parking problems. Professors can park right underground the teaching buildings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Circulation Intensification - Allow cars and people into the site, which used to be separated for landscapes. More space experiencing with denser circulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Functional Intensification - Introduce daily service on the first floor. Add space for class, hotel, and recreation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Relationships Intensification - Connect the new buildings with the existing ones with roof gardens and ground yards.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-intensification-in-built-site">The Intensification In Built Site</h2>

<p>The urban space is continually expanding over the years, with the distance growing, the resources being depleted and the pollution worsening.</p>

<p><em>However, have the existing urban land been fully developed and utilized?</em></p>

<p><em>When space so-called left for landscape is transformed into an urban area with a specific density, will the city be more active?</em></p>

<p><em>What kind of relationships should be developed between buildings? 
What kind of synergy can be formed? 
Can we build organic and smart cities, neighborhoods, and homes?</em></p>

<p>Based on these thinkings, the topic is focused on the existing urban space - the space between the main entrance and administrative building in Tsinghua.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/01/27/rwR1FPqUYKlzAfH.jpg" alt="03-3" /></p>

<p>The project is proposed as an extension of the existing grid in South Boston neighborhood and as the connection to the MBTA transit system.</p>

<p>The road and infrastructure system overrides the flooding area in the future to make room for housing, with the walk lanes going over the water between the housing area.</p>

<h2 id="zoning-strategy">Zoning Strategy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zoning Strategy Based On Risks Of Sea Level Rise, Concerns On Sunlight, And Treatment Of Brownfields</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the areas facing fewer risks of sea-level rise, the density tends to be higher with more towers in the north row, to make the community more accessible to the marsh parks.</p>

<p>The power plant is partly reserved as the MBTA transit center and the commercial area. On the site of brownfields, there should be public buildings as the brownfields being treated gradually.</p>

<h2 id="housing-types--scenarios">Housing Types &amp; Scenarios</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Row houses with gardens - The low-density houses from the South Boston neighborhood.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Towers - The high-density houses from downtown Boston.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bar buildings - The medium-density houses from downtown Boston.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, in concern with the sunlight, each west-east main district contains two rows of housing buildings - the 3-floor row houses with gardens on the south and the towers or bar buildings on the north.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/01/27/FgPE528AJepN9lj.jpg" alt="06-1" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Short term: Before 2030, there should be the first row of towers and bar buildings in the northernmost end of the site because of the best view to the sea and the easiest access to downtown Boston by cars.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/01/27/NPd2BXusOWhbARi.jpg" alt="06-2.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mid term: Before 2050, with the brownfields appropriately treated and the sea level rising, swamp parks are developed between the new city grids. With the site connected to the MBTA transit system, more people should move in, and most houses are built to hold the growing population.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/01/27/x8fKk1IOsZ7B3uX.jpg" alt="06-3.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Long term: Before 2070, on the sites of brownfields, there will be public buildings offering service to the community, and the row houses will also be built.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Detail Design Of The Core Area Near The Transportation System And The Infrastructure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The power plant is partly reserved and redesigned as the transit center for MBTA, the commercial center of the site, and the outdoor green space. Other industry relics are developed as the library and museum.</p>

<p>The bar buildings around the core area are treated differently, considering the commercial space and landscape.</p>

<p>The infrastructure network goes with the main roads inside the platforms, including electricity, gas, and water.</p>
