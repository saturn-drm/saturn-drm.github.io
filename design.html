                        <p>The project located in Wudaokou with several schools, IT centers, government offices and
                            malls around. People here only went out of the office at meal and were squeezed onto the
                            road by the massive pedestrians.<br>In the compact urban space, the project aimed to offer
                            not only a traditional theater, but a system of the open space for everyone's experiecing,
                            exhibition, communication and performing. The activities expand the timeline in which the
                            workers, students and residents use the space.</p>
