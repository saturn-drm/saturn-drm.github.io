# Design Stages

## The Intensification In Built Site

The urban space is continually expanding over the years, with the distance growing, the resources being depleted and the pollution worsening.

However, have the existing urban land been fully developed and utilized?

When space so-called left for landscape is transformed into an urban area with a specific density, will the city be more active?

What kind of relationships should be developed between buildings? 
What kind of synergy can be formed? 
Can we build organic and smart cities, neighborhoods, and homes?

Based on these thinkings, the topic is focused on the existing urban space - the space between the main entrance and administrative building in Tsinghua.
