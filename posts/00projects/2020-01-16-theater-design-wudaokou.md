# Conceptual

## Expansion of people's timelines & activities

![02conceptual](../../assets/img/00architecture/06theaterdesign/02conceptual.jpg)

There are already schools, offices, malls, and residential buildings around, leaving little open space for the citizen. Studying the activity timelines of the residents, office workers and students in the neighborhood, we can learn that most of the activities occur at meal. 

By introducing the elements of culture and art here, the theater contributes to a further diversification of the open space and attracting people come here in different period of a day by the performance and exhibition.

## Developing open space

The main entrance is faced with the main road of South Tsinghua Rd, followed by an alley passing through the building. There are open spaces at both end of the alley, defining the performing and communication space for citizens. Along the alley there is a demensional exhibition space.

# Renders

## The mirrored stage for citizens

The glass wall acts both as the background of the experimental theater and the square. People can perform their own activities on the square while being framed into the scene inside. At the same time, the night sky is contained in the scene on both sides.
