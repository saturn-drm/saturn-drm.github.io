# Basic Info

* The project is an extension of the existing grid and transportation system, which overrides the mostly underwater site in the future.* It deals with the risks of rising sea level and annual flood by chronological design in the short-medium-long term.* It contains a mixture of three house types from the local, which are arranged according to the site condition facing the risks of rising sea level and annual flood chronologically.* The housing buildings show a transition in demography from the South Boston neighborhood to downtown Boston.* Public buildings are proposed and reserved according to the distribution of existing brownfields, which also contains the progressive design with the brownfields being treated gradually.
