# Abstract

* The project is an extension of the existing grid and transportation system, which overrides the mostly underwater site in the future.* It deals with the risks of rising sea level and annual flood by chronological design in the short-medium-long term.* It contains a mixture of three house types from the local, which are arranged according to the site condition facing the risks of rising sea level and annual flood chronologically.* The housing buildings show a transition in demography from the South Boston neighborhood to downtown Boston.* Public buildings are proposed and reserved according to the distribution of existing brownfields, which also contains the progressive design with the brownfields being treated gradually.

# Design Stages

## Risk And Potential

Like other areas in Boston, the site faces the risks of rising sea level and annual flood. By the year 2070, half of the site will be submerged. Besides, there are some industry relics on the site, including the brownfields that used to be oil tanks and the power plant.![03-1](https://i.loli.net/2020/01/27/6aA5L7vK92T1dxr.jpg)

The road and infrastructure system overrides the flooding area in the future to make room for housing, with the walk lanes going over the water between the housing area.

## Zoning Strategy

Zoning strategies are based on risks of sea level rise, concerns on sunlight, and treatment of brownfields.In the areas facing fewer risks of sea-level rise, the density tends to be higher with more towers in the north row, to make the community more accessible to the marsh parks.The power plant is partly reserved as the MBTA transit center and the commercial area. On the site of brownfields, there should be public buildings as the brownfields being treated gradually.
